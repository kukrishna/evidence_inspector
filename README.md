# Evidence Inspector

Evidence Inspector is a tool designed to help in fact-checking statements, especially AI-generated text against reference documents.

To view example outputs from the system in different usecases, go to http://evinspector.site

To run the system on Colab, go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FJf24CLNkhT_bt1F2XcuSz_ARy3Jnapp?usp=sharing

To run the system on your own machine (requires GPU), you can clone this repository and follow the same commands and instructions given in the Colab notebook.
